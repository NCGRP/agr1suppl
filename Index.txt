The files in this archive contain notes and an annotated pipeline for analysis of data sets
used in the publication.  The purpose of the archive is to fully document analytical
procedures so that the methods might be replicated in different processing environments
after necessary modifications are made. The file Index.txt contains descriptions of the
resources contained in the archive. Please contact the authors with specific questions
regarding use of the applications, scripts, pipelines, and routines.
